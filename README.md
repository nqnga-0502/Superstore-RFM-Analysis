## Problem Statement
RFM analysis is a marketing analysis tool used to identify a company's or an organization's best customers by using three quantitative measures 
which are Recency (R), Frequency (F), Monetary (M).
<br>
There are three metrics used on RFM analysis:

* **Recency (R)** <br>
   Elapsed time (e.g. days, weeks, months, etc.) since last order / purchase / engagement of a customer with a service / product.
* **Frequency (F)** <br>
  Total number of orders / purchases or average times between visit / engagement of a customer with a service / product.
* **Monetary (M)** <br>
  Total or average of transaction value (e.g. total amount spent on transactions of a customer with a service / product).
